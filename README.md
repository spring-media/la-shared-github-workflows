# la-shared-github-workflows

This repo hosts shared github workflows used by other repositories.

Please refer to githubs documentation on how to use and implement shared workflows: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows

## Workflows

- [slack-notify-after-production-deploy](#slack-notify-after-production-deploy)
- [js\_\_format-lint-test](#js__format-lint-test)

### js\_\_format-lint-test

The [js\_\_format-lint-test workflow](./.github/workflows/reusable-workflow__js__format-lint-test.yml) will install dependencies and then run these npm commands on the project:

- `install`
- `format-check`
- `lint`
- `test`

If the projects `package.json` doesn't provide all of these scripts, the workflow will fail.

It also requires to secrets to be passed in:

- `NPM_AUTH_TOKEN`
- `LA_TECH_USER_AUTH_TOKEN`

The node version has to be set via a `.node-version` file.

#### Usage

```yaml
jobs:
  â€¦
  format-lint-and-unit-test:
    uses: spring-media/la-shared-github-workflows/.github/workflows/reusable-workflow__js__format-lint-test.yml@main
    secrets:
      NPM_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{secrets.NPM_AUTH_TOKEN}}
      LA_TECH_USER_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.LA_TECH_USER_AUTH_TOKEN }}
```

### slack-notify-after-production-deploy

The [slack-notify-after-production-deploy workflow](./.github/workflows/reusable-workflow__slack-notify-after-production-deploy.yaml) notifies our slack channel `#t_loyalty_notifications` whether a deployment was successful or not.

#### Usage

The Slack deployment notification consists of an extra job that needs to be added to your deployment pipeline.

Add the job `inform-slack` to the end(!) of your github actions file.
Then you will and exchange the ID in `needs: [<ADD JOB ID>]` and in
`success: ${{ needs.<ADD JOB ID>.result == 'success' }}`.

The name of the deployment job in this example is `deploy`, so you will change the two lines with to `needs: [deploy]`
and `success: ${{ needs.deploy.result == 'success' }}` respectively.

The job handles every case, by: `if: ${{ always() }}` it will always run, no matter the state of the jobs before, the
line `needs: [<ADD JOB ID>]` makes it wait until the deployment job has finished (in any way) and
`success: ${{ needs.<ADD JOB ID>.result == 'success' }}` hands in a boolean, `true` in case the run was successful,
`false` in case it was a failure, skipped or cancelled.

```yaml
name: deploy

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master

jobs:
  deploy: ... A lot of stuff usually happens here ...

  slack-notify-after-production-deploy:
    needs: [<ADD JOB ID>]
    if: ${{ always() }}
    uses: spring-media/la-shared-github-workflows/.github/workflows/reusable-workflow__slack-notify-after-production-deploy.yaml@main
    with:
      workflow: ${{ github.workflow }}
      repository: ${{ github.repository }}
      repositoryUrl: ${{ github.event.repository.url }}
      refName: ${{ github.ref_name }}
      success: ${{ needs.<ADD JOB ID>.result == 'success' }}
    secrets:
      SLACK_BOT_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SLACK_BOT_TOKEN }}
```
